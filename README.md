# BATTLESHIPS

This repo is console-based battleship game. It is under not-so-frequent development. Currently it does not work yet.

## SCOPE:
There are two scopes: one for MVP and other for 'full product'. 

### MVP
For MVP this is going to be one player game. 
1. Player starts the game.
2. Game randomly places battleships on game board.
3. Player has one move: to select a field.
4. After field is selected, game checks if something was hit.
5. No hit ends current turn.
5. Hit gives player another hit in same turn.
6. If all pieces of any ship are hit, ship is sunk.
7. After all ships are sunk game finishes and shows score (number of turns taken).

This requires additional features such as move validation.


### Full scope:
- Possibility to play like in normal battleships (both players, human and PC are placing ships and can sink them).
- Some strategy for AI to place ships.
- Some strategy for AI to look for player ships.
- Highscore table.
- Player set name.
- possibility to play with two human players?
